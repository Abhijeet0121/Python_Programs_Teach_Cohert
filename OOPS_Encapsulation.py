#The idea of encapsulation is to bind the data members and methods into a single unit

class Employee:
    def __init__(self, name, salary):
        self.name = name          # public attribute
        self.__salary = salary    # private attribute

emp = Employee("Fedrick", 50000)
print(emp.name)       
print(emp.__salary)

#2. Protected members are variables or
#  methods that are intended to be accessed only within the class and its subclasses.
class Employee:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name       # public
        self._age = age        # protected

class SubEmployee(Employee):
    def show_age(self):
        print("Age:", self._age)   # Accessible in subclass

emp = SubEmployee("Ross", 30)
print(emp.name)        # Public accessible
emp.show_age()         # Protected accessed through subclass
